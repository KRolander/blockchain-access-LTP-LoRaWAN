# IoT Blockchain board project 
In this project, we integrate IoT devices with several blockchains, such as Hyperledger Fabric, Hyperledger Sawtooth, Substrate blockchain and Ethereum.

We present a a Lightweight Transaction Protocol (LTP) for enabling constrained embedded devicesâ€™ interaction with multiple types of blockchains via the LoRaWAN communication protocol.

This work was presented at the 12th International Conference on the Internet of Things 2022, TU Delft the Netherlands.
